I was enrolled in a Meta React Native Specialization course which was provided by Meta.

As a part of this course, there was an Capstone (React App) project at the end of program, where I build this Application.

I utilize various React Native libraries and components to produce an onboarding flow, navigation routes, a customizable profile page and a food-ordering interface.

This is the final project for the React App Capstone, part of the Meta React Native Specialization Certificate program. The app is a food ordering app that allows users to browse Little Lemon restaurant's menu and place orders.
